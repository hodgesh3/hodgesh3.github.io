    	<h2>New Patients</h2>
        <p><em>Obtaining Your Medical History: </em>Before seeing you for the first time, Dr. Matheson would like to learn more about your medical history by obtaining your chart from every physician you have seen in the past ten years, plus the documentation of any surgeries, emergency room visits or hospitalizations. We are happy to assist you in this process. One of the <a href="#">forms</a> needed is an <a href="#">Authorization to Release Medical Information</a>. Please sign this form and copy as necessary to present one to each health care provider to send us your records. If you would prefer, you can give us the signed form with a list of providers; we will then fax it to everyone on your list and follow-up until the records are received. We will not be able to schedule a new patient appointment without your records from your previous physicians. No medication refills can be ordered until you are seen by Dr. Matheson. This form, along with our others can be found <a href="#">here</a> or by clicking on the forms tab in the menu bar.</p>
        <br />
        <p><em>Establishing Your New Chart: </em>
 There are four forms we ask you to complete to establish your chart. First, is a <a href="#">brief history form</a>. The <a href="#">second</a> gives us information on how to contact you, permission to treat you, how to bill you, and other pertinent information. This form refers to our <a href="#">Notice of Privacy Practice</a> and asks you to acknowledge that these policies have been shared with you (this policy is posted on this website and is always posted in the waiting room). Third, is the <a href="#">Authorization to Release Medical Information</a>, explained above.  Finally, there is our <a href="#">Payment Policy</a> that we ask you to read and sign. All three forms can be returned with the <a href="#">Authorization to Release Medical Information</a>. At this time, you may want to check if Dr. Matheson participates with your insurance plan, or discuss discounts available for self-paying patients.
